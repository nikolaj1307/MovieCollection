WELCOME to your Private MovieCollection.

This readme file will help the user operate the program and how to import all the necessary libraries.

The lib folder in the program will inform the user about the used libraries in the program:
gson-2.10.1.jar
jackson-core-asl-1.8.6.jar
jackson-datatype-json-org-1.8.0.jar
jackson-mapper-asl-1.8.6.jar
json-20090211.jar
materialfx-11.13.5.jar
mssql-jdbc-12.4.2.jre11.jar
virtualizedfx-11.2.6.jar

In case you want to open the program in SceneBuilder, will you 
need to add the materialfx in there as well.


We also chose to use a API. The API key is generated by TMDB.
If needed, you can signup for free to get a API key.
